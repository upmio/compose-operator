## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code is properly formatted (`make fmt`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated for significant changes

### PR Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use a clear and descriptive title
   - `feat: add Redis replication support`
   - `fix: resolve MySQL connection timeout issue`
   - `docs: update installation guide`

2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made and why
   - Any breaking changes
   - Testing instructions
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)

3. **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
   - Large PRs are harder to review
   - Consider breaking large features into smaller PRs

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD, tests, linting)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Documentation review** if docs are changed
4. **Final approval** by a maintainer

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions and use automated tools to enforce consistency:

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint

# Vet code
make vet
```

### Code Organization

```
â”œâ”€â”€ api/v1alpha1/          # API definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/                   # Main applications
â”œâ”€â”€ controller/            # Controllers
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/                   # Library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mysqlutil/         # MySQL utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ redisutil/         # Redis utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/             # Common utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration files
â””â”€â”€ examples/              # Example manifests
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Packages**: lowercase, single word when possible
- **Functions**: camelCase, exported functions start with uppercase
- **Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE with underscores
- **Files**: lowercase with underscores

### Error Handling

```go
// Good: Wrap errors with context
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to connect to database %s: %w", host, err)
}

// Good: Use specific error types
var ErrConnectionTimeout = errors.New("database connection timeout")

// Avoid: Generic error messages
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Logging

Use structured logging with appropriate levels:

```go
log := ctrl.Log.WithName("mysql-controller")

// Info for normal operations
log.Info("Successfully configured replication", "source", source, "replica", replica)

// Error for error conditions
log.Error(err, "Failed to establish replication", "source", source)

// Debug for detailed troubleshooting
log.V(1).Info("Connecting to database", "host", host, "port", port)
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
controller/
â”œâ”€â”€ mysqlreplication/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mysqlreplication_controller.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mysqlreplication_controller_test.go  # Controller tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ suite_test.go                        # Test suite setup
```

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and methods
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

```go
func TestMysqlReplication(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        spec    v1alpha1.MysqlReplicationSpec
        want    error
    }{
        {
            name: "valid configuration",
            spec: v1alpha1.MysqlReplicationSpec{...},
            want: nil,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test controller behavior with real Kubernetes API
- Use envtest for controller testing
- Test common scenarios and edge cases

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 70% code coverage
- Critical paths should have higher coverage
- Run coverage reports: `make test-coverage`

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Public functions and types must have godoc comments
- Comments should explain **why**, not just **what**
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

```go
// MysqlReplicationReconciler reconciles a MysqlReplication object.
// It manages the replication topology between MySQL instances by
// monitoring their status and configuring replication relationships.
type MysqlReplicationReconciler struct {
    client.Client
    Scheme *runtime.Scheme
}
```
