## Decision Making Process

### Consensus Building

The project operates on a consensus-based decision-making model:

1. **Proposal**: Significant changes are proposed through GitHub issues or discussions
2. **Discussion**: Community members provide feedback and suggestions
3. **Iteration**: Proposals are refined based on feedback
4. **Consensus**: Maintainers work to reach agreement on the proposal
5. **Implementation**: Approved changes are implemented and merged

### Conflict Resolution

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. **Escalation**: Conflicts are escalated to the Steering Committee
2. **Mediation**: The Steering Committee facilitates discussion between parties
3. **Decision**: If mediation fails, the Steering Committee makes the final decision
4. **Documentation**: All decisions and rationale are documented publicly

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the Compose Operator project are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For general questions and community discussions
- **Email**: For private communication with maintainers
- **Community Meetings**: Monthly virtual meetings (schedule TBD)

## Project Lifecycle

### Release Process

The project follows semantic versioning (SemVer) with regular releases:

- **Major releases**: Breaking changes, new architecture
- **Minor releases**: New features, improvements
- **Patch releases**: Bug fixes, security updates

### Long-term Support (LTS)

The project maintains LTS versions with extended support periods for critical bug fixes and security updates.

## Modification of Governance

This governance document can be modified through the following process:

1. **Proposal**: Submit a pull request with proposed changes
2. **Review Period**: Minimum 30-day review period for community feedback
3. **Consensus**: Approval by majority of maintainers and Steering Committee
4. **Implementation**: Changes take effect after merge

## Acknowledgments

This governance model is inspired by successful open source projects including Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other CNCF projects.
